					<h2>Eagle Scout Project</h2>
					<p>I am on the wrestling team and we didn't have any spots to hang up our weight vests. We would just throw them on the bleachers in the wrestling room, and they would take up lots of space. I raised the money and built weight vest hooks out of wood. Then we took them to the high school and installed them.</p>
